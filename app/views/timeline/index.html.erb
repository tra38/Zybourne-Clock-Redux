The evil dictator 'Johnny Five-Ace' has destroyed our country in a great war, leaving you as a bitter war veteran. Luckily, you discovered a device called the Zybourne Clock within the ruins of the Civilus Primiscotas. Johnny once used this Clock to help him win the great war. <br><br> Now, it's time to use the Clock's power against Johnny.

        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Zybourne Clock was originally a 2003 game project that went horribly off-the-rails (over 50 people volunteered, 0 knew how to program). Starting from 2012, I started work on a remake of the project, trying to stay close to the original "canon" material while also producing an interesting game. If you are interested more about my thought-process while making this game, please visit my <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=111311.0">dev diary</a> for more information, or you may <a href="https://github.com/tra38/Zybourne-Clock-Redux">look at the source code.</a></p>

All three superpowers were reliant on cheap coal to fuel their industrial growth and might...and that cheap coal was running out...</strong></p>
