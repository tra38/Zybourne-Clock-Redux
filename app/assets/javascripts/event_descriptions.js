var CITY_FIVE_BUILT = "<p>CITY FIVE BUILT - Bookworld, Rasenni and Capital agreed to build a major coal-mining facility called City 5. Though all three superpowers became economically prosperous, they became overly reliant on City 5 to provide for their coal needs. The supersoldier Johnny Five-Ace realized that if City 5 was destroyed, it could ruin the global economy and allow for Capital to conquer the other two superpowers.</p>"

var THE_ORDER = "<p>THE ORDER - The major world powers established a global religion called The Order, which promoted social stability at all costs. Every human is a 'squeaky gear' that must serve the prescribed instructions of the Great Machine, lest the machine breaks down and an Error Message is Thrown. Deviant scientists were burned by steampunk clerics wishing to protect the Great Machine.</p>"

var CLOCK_INVENTED = "<p>CLOCK INVENTED - Dr. Zybourne invented a time-traveling Clock that would modify the global climate. He hoped that changing the global climate will boost human evolution, making them more technologically advanced. This technological advancement also led to an improvement of Capital's armed forces, allowing for Johnny Five-Ace to conduct research into terrifying weapons of mass destruction.</p>"

var ZEPPLINS = "<p>ZEPPLINS - Despite the various techniques used by the superpowers to keep order, periodic industrial strikes and workers' uprisings still took place. The military-industrial complex of Capital came up with a solution: arming zeppelins with bombs and threatening to blow up any rebellious city.  Johnny Five-Ace made a lot of money selling these highly-valued weapons to the other superpowers, which he used to improve Capital's own military might.</p>"

var CHILD_SPYBOTS = "<p>CHILD SPYBOTS - 'Ministry Incorporated', a weapons producer in Rasenni, developed unique spybots that can sneak into top-secret compounds by posing as little girls. These spybots are remarkbly effective, allowing for Rasenni to secretly spy on Capital's military forces and prepare for Johnny Five-Ace's plans. However, some of the child spybots rebelled against their creators after complaining about 'unfair wages'. These spybots formented labor uprisings throughout the world.</p>"

var VAUNDERMAUSE = "<p>VAUNDERMAUSE - Vaundermause (real name: Thomas Redding) was an infamous bounty hunter who hated technology after someone threw a steam-powered brick into his stained-glass windows. Vaundermause was secretly hired by Rasenni to launch sabotoge operations against Capital's military-industrial complex. Vaundermause successfully burned down numerous R&D labs, before Johnny Five-Ace defeated Vaundermause in hand-to-hand combat.</p>"

var SOCIAL_PLANNING = "<p>SOCIAL PLANNING REVOLUTION - In a landmark peer-reviewed case study, Dr. Zybourne discovered that the cities of Rasenni were poorly designed, with military testing facilities placed right next to office buildings and slums located next to mansions. In response to Dr. Zybourne's criticism, the cities of Rasenni went through an urban renewal program designed to improve the quality of life of its citizenry while increasing economic growth. To fund this massive Revolution, Rasenni decided to reduce defense spending.</p>"

var NANOTECH = "<p>NANOTECH - Bookworld hired the famous scientist Dr. Malprop to help improve the 'labor force' of their factories. Dr. Malprop's experiments created technologically advanced workers who can produce both civilian and military supplies at break-neck speeds. However, these workers started seeing themselves as 'superior' to their 'non-agumented' superiors and started demanding higher benefits. Workers' unrest increased drastically. Capital and Rasenni, scared by the workers' unrest, refused to buy any nanotech upgrades from Dr. Malprop.</p>"

var LUDDIST_CRUSADE = "<p>LUDDIST CRUSADE - In a major speech, the wealthy industrialist Sam McLaughlin denounced all forms of mechanical tools (hammers, screwdrivers, steam-powered bricks etc.) as being 'souless beings who will take away the jobs that rightfully belongs to the master human race'. She raised a legion of highly-dedicated zealots to defend social stability by burning down anything that looks remotely like a tool. Johnny Five-Ace provided Sam McLaughin's zealots with funding and training, and in return, Sam endorsed Johnny Five-Ace's reign.</p>"

//Descriptions of Key Events: depedencies that occur as a result of your balls
var CITY_FIVE_WAR = "<p>KEY EVENT - CITY 5 WAR: As the world superpowers continue to expand their energy needs, they began to dispute over how the coal would be divided at the strategic location of City 5. Both Bookworld and Rasenni got greedy and pressured Capital to surrender its rights to the coal at City 5. This proved unpopular with the masses, allowing for Johnny Five-Ace to launch a military coup and establish a dictatorship. He launched the 'CITY 5 WAR' by fieldtesting a 'permanent flamethrower' onto the disputed territory, incinerating City 5, killing millions of civilians, and damaging the economy of both Bookworld and Rasenni.</p>"

var COAL_WAR = "<p>KEY EVENT - COAL WARS: As the world superpowers continue to expand their energy needs, they began to fight with each other over strategic coal reserves. During these small-scale skrimishes, Johnny Five-Ace performed admirably, eventually rising in the ranks to be the Supreme General of Capital. He then established a dictatorship and mobilized Capital's forces to 'end' the Cold Wars by destroying the other superpowers. Bookworld and Rasenni quickly formed a cease-fire to combine their forces against the Capital threat.</p>"

var JOHNNY_WINS = "<p>Johnny Five-Ace quickly smashed the combined forces of Bookworld and Rasenni with the help of Anti-Grav Tanks, Telsa Cannons, and the coveted Johnny Gun. The Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition collapsed and Capital took over the entire world. Johnny Five-Ace quickly consolidated his rule, creating a massive personality cult designed to give legitimacy to his dictatorship and grooming his best friend, Scholtz, to succeed him.</p>"

var JOHNNY_LOSES = "<p>The military might of Capital did not even begin to match the combined strength of the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition, and Johnny Five-Ace went underground to avoid being captured and executed by the victorous Coalition forces. The Republic of Capital was once again re-established, and peace once again ensured.</p>"

var STALEMATE = "<p>Though Johnny Five-Ace made remarkable progress in fighting against the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition, his forces was soon bogged down fighting against guerrillas. Neither side were willing to surrender, and so a bloody stalemate ensured. It appeared that humanity was headed towards extiniction, if the conflict does not stop.</p>"

//Events Tied To Johnny's Victory
var THE_MADNESS_PART_ONE = "<p>KEY EVENT - THE MADNESS: Johnny Five-Ace's regime became increasingly erratic and brutal, as he became addicted to absolute power. Hundreds of thousands of people were executed for violating strange decrees like 'no card-counting in poker', or sent to prison camps where they were forced to create cigars that only Johnny Five-Ace could use. Even Scholtz would end up living in these prison camps, for the crime of not taking enough photographs of Johnny.</p>"

var THE_MADNESS_PART_TWO = "<p>But, of course, such a brutal dictatorship would never last. After Johnny Five-Ace's natural death, his loyalist cronies soon fought among themselves for the spoils. While still claiming adherence to Johnny's whims, they established their own private fiefdoms. Shifting alliances and mutual hositility became the buzzwords of the day.</p>"

var SYNDICALIST_REVOLUTION_PART_ONE = "<p>KEY EVENT - SYNDICALIST REVOLUTION: After Johnny Five-Ace's natural death, Scholtz attempted to maintain control over his empire. But Scholtz lacked the same talent and charisma that Five-Ace had, and new social changes were taking place in Capital that were spiraling out of control. Workers' unrest began to spread unchecked, and soon a worldwide revolution took place. Scholtz was captured and executed, and the new regime began tearing down all elements of the 'old order'. However, even the new regime could not prevent chaos and anarchy from spreading.</p>"

var SYNDICALIST_REVOLUTION_PART_TWO = "<p>The Syndicalist rebels soon began to fight among themselves on the basis of greed and ideology, thereby destroying what little unity that remained of Johnny's empire. These rebels established their own private fiefdoms. Shifting alliances and mutual hositility became the buzzwords of the day.</p>"

var JOHNNY_CLONES_PART_ONE = "<p>KEY EVENT - THE JOHNNY-CLONES: After Johnny Five-Ace's natural death, Scholtz attempted to maintain control over his empire. He relied on a new cadre of supersoliders (cloned from the DNA of Johnny Five-Ace) to keep the masses in check. This worked, for a time. But eventually, these supersoliders demanded more power from Scholtz. As Scholtz feared being overthrown by the Johnny-Clones, Scholtz gave into those demands.</p>"

var JOHNNY_CLONES_PART_TWO = "<p>After Scholtz's natural death, the Johnny-Clones soon began to fight among themselves on the basis of greed and ideology, thereby destroying the unity of Johnny's empire. These clones established their own private fiefdoms. Shifting alliances and mutual hositility became the buzzwords of the day.</p>"

//Events Tied To Johnny's Defeat
var ERA_OF_PEACE = "<p>KEY EVENT - ERA OF PEACE: The restored Republic of Capital proved to be docile to the wishes of the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition. The Coalition was able to make long-term plans without fear that they can be disrupted by popular uprisings or be forced to negotiate with the lower-classes. In fact, as society prospered, the masses grew to tolerate the elites, who at least are able to keep the trains on time. This allowed Bookworld and Rasenni to focus on the big issue of the day: how to deal with Peak Coal.</p>"

var SECOND_CAPITAL_WAR_PART_ONE = "<p>KEY EVENT - SECOND CAPITAL WAR: The restored Republic of Capital was very unpopular with the Capital masses, who saw the government as a puppet of the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition and believed that they do not have to listen to the wishes of the upper classes but instead can do whatever they want and please. The popular Johnny Five-Ace came out of hiding to lead a revolution to overthrow the Republic. The Coalition and Capital was once again at war with each other. However Johnny Five-Ace was not interested in winning this war, but instead in destroying the Coalition and thereby securing his vengeance. Johnny developed potent bioweapons that would cause massive civilian casualities within the Coalition.</p>"

var SECOND_CAPITAL_WAR_PART_TWO = "<p>Even though the Coalition ultimately won the Second Capital War, it was a pyrrhic victory. Without any civilian labor force to to sustain economic growth, both Bookworld and Rasenni collapsed. Capital too collapsed under the onslaught of the Coalition. Without any central government to mantain order, the world quickly fell into chaos and anarchy. Powerful warlords soon established their own private fiefdoms. Shifting alliances and mutual hositility became the buzzwords of the day.</p>"

var CAPITAL_PROTESTS_PART_ONE = "<p>KEY EVENT - CAPITAL PROTESTS: The restored Republic of Capital was very unpopular with the Capital masses, who saw the government as a puppet of the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition and believed that they do not have to listen to the wishes of the upper classes but instead can do whatever they want and please. The masses waited patiently for Johnny Five-Ace to come out of hiding, but he never did (rumors claimed that Johnny had left the planet to find new adventures). So the masses launched a series of non-violent protests on their own, demanding that the 'Republic' actually start taking their opinions into account. The protests were eventually quelled by a series of political compromises and dialogue between the protesters and the Coalition.</p>"

var CAPITAL_PROTESTS_PART_TWO = "<p>After the uprising, there was no more unrest in Capital. In fact, as society prospered, the masses grew to tolerate the elites, who at least are able to keep the trains on time. This allowed Bookworld and Rasenni to focus on the big issue of the day: how to deal with Peak Coal.</p>"

//Events Tied To Stalemate
var TECHNOCRACY_PART_ONE = "<p>KEY EVENT - THE TECHNOCRACY: The bloody stalemate and prepetual war had caused many scientists to lose faith in all three superpowers. Two such scientists, Dr. Zybourne and Dr. Malprop, went rogue and seized complete control of Bookworld's R&D program. Both Zybourne and Malprop argued that since the politicians have failed, it was now the responsiblity of scientists to create a 'new and better world'.</p>"

var TECHNOCRACY_PART_TWO = "<p>More scientists defected to the forces of Dr. Malprop, and he eventually got enough strength to annihilate all three superpowers and establish a unified Technocracy. The masses strongly supported the return of stability, allowing Dr. Malprop and his supporters to focus on the big issue of the day: how to deal with Peak Coal.</p>"

var JOHNNY_DISAPPERANCE_PART_ONE = "<p>KEY EVENT - JOHNNY'S DISAPPERANCE: Johnny Five-Ace tried every trick in the book to destroy the prepetual war, but only saw failure. Though he can destroy the leadership of Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition easily, more people took their place. Johnny watched as even his most loyal soldiers engaged in brutal counter-insurgency tactics that only made the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition more appealing to the masses. Johnny Five-Ace, disgusted at his own incompetence and the disloyalty of his soldiers, resigned from his post and went into hiding.</p>"

var JOHNNY_DISAPPERANCE_PART_TWO = "<p>Without any central government to mantain order, the world quickly fell into chaos and anarchy. Powerful warlords soon established their own private fiefdoms. Shifting alliances and mutual hositility became the buzzwords of the day.</p>"

var TREATY_OF_OVERTURE_PART_ONE = "<p>KEY EVENT - THE TREATY OF OVERTURE: While Johnny Five-Ace could not suppress the insurgency entirely, he was able to severely weaken the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition to the point that they could not pose a threat to his regime. After Johnny's natural death, Scholtz agreed to negotiate with the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition to end the war. In return for laying down their arms, the Bookworld-Rasenni Coalition was given amnesty and local autonomy.</p>"

var TREATY_OF_OVERTURE_PART_TWO = "<p>Though nobody really won the World War, peace has returned at last. The treaty allowed Scholtz and his loyalist cronies to focus on the big issue of the day: how to deal with Peak Coal.</p>"

//"Civilized" reactions to 'Peak Coal'
var EXDOUS = "<p>KEY EVENT - THE EXDOUS. The world leadership decided that there was not enough coal on the planet to sustain humanity. Therefore, they heroically decided that the planet was obsolete and not worth living on. Humanity slowly began migrating away from our world over to other planets throughout the galaxy, draining the unlucky planet dry before moving onto the next victim. Civilization was spreading, and will keep on spreading, without end, without point...</p>"

var CIVILIZED_EXTINICTION = "<p>KEY EVENT - EXTINICTION. The global leadership decided that Peak Coal was impossible to stop, and so instead focused on keeping power at all costs. They focused on mass-murdering their enemies, without regard for petty concerns like survival. When there was no more enmies to slaughter, the leadership decided to murder each other in useless power struggles. Coal was exhausted, and without any possibility for technological innovation, society essentially collapsed. Humanity died, and its loss was not mourned by anyone.</p>"

var RATIONING = "<p>KEY EVENT - RATIONING. The global leadership decided that the only way to stop Peak Coal from destroying society was to limit the amount of Coal that any person can ever use. They implemented a strict rationing system, only giving the highest rations to the elites. Those who violate the rationing system would be executed on the spot, with their bodies force-converted into coal. It is a rather despotic and austere era, but civilization still prospered. That's a good thing.</p>"

//"Savage" reactions to 'Peak Coal'
var TECHNO_BARBARISM = "<p>KEY EVENT - THE ERA OF TECHNO-BARBARISM. The various fiefdoms of the old order soon began to consolidate themselves into 'tribes' who fought endless 'blood feuds' against one another. These 'tribes' began to realize however that there was not enough Coal on the planet to sustain their constant conflicts. Rather than seeing this as an opportunity to end their savage ways, the tribes began migrating away from our world over to other planets throughout the galaxy. The chance that mankind would ever again reach a semi-civilized status is minimal.</p>"

var SAVAGE_EXTINICTION = "<p>KEY EVENT - EXTINICTION. The various fiefdoms of the old order focused on mass-murdering their enemies, without regard for petty concerns like survival. When the fiefdoms did end up winning, they only decided to murder each other in useless power struggles. Coal was exhausted, and without any possibility for technological innovation, the fiefdoms essentially collapsed. Humanity died, and its loss was not mourned by anyone.</p>"

var RITUALIZED_BLOOD_FEUDS = "<p>KEY EVENT - RITUALIZED BLOOD FEUDS. The various fiefdoms of the old order soon began to consolidate themselves into 'tribes' who fought endless 'blood feuds' against one another. However, the savages were at semi-intelligent enough to realize that their wars were wasteful and costing valuable Coal. The tribes agreed to a ritualized form of combat that would resolve disputes efficiently. Still, the chance that mankind would ever again reach a semi-civilized status is minimal.</p>"
